# tempserver
start a temp server anywhere you want



#Install

Express is the only dependency. 
```sh
	npm install
```
Remember the path where you clone to .
for me it is
```sh
 "/Users/judastree/tempserver/"	
``` 
#Start

run this command , it will start a server on port 3000 . and the root path be the derectory where you execute this command
```sh
	node {path}/tempserver.js
```
for me , it is:
```sh	
	node /Users/judastree/tempserver/tempserver.js
```
one more step, you can give this command with alias
```sh
	 alias tempserver='node /Users/judastree/mygithub/tempserver/tempserver.js'
```

so running alias 'tempserver' can do all for you 
```sh
	tempserver
```
